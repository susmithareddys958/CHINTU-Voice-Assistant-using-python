Hello coders!  
In this post, I built a super cool Python project called **CHINTU – Your Personal Voice Assistant**.

## ✨ What Can CHINTU Do?

✅ Listen to your voice  
✅ Understand what you said  
✅ Open Chrome or VS Code

## 🛠️ Tools Required

- Python 3.8 or above  
- VS Code (or any code editor)  
- A microphone  
- Internet connection (for YouTube/Wikipedia)

---

## 🧪 Step 1: Create Project Folder

- Open VS Code  
- Create a new folder for your project

## 🔁 Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Run this in your terminal:
python -m venv venv

Activate it:

source venv/bin/activate
You’ll see (venv) in your terminal – that means your environment is active ✅
